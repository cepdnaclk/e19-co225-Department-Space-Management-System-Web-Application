## Description

A system to manage the common spaces like labs , conference rooms , discussion rooms and a lunch room in the department. Lecturers and instructors should have access to book the common spaces if they are available. As an example , Letâ€™s say the lecturer wants to book Computer Lab 01 but it is already booked in the particular time slot. Then the lecturer can add him/her to the waiting list. Whenever the previous reservation is canceled, the lecturer will get a notification about the cancellation with a request to confirm the reservation. Then the lecturer just has to confirm or cancel the reservation.
