## Description
A system to manage  the common spaces like labs , conference rooms , discussion  rooms and a lunch room in the department.  Lecturers and  instructors should have access to  book the common  spaces if they are available. As an example , Let’s say the lecturer  wants to book Computer Lab 01 but it is already booked in the particular time slot.  Then the lecturer can add him/her to the waiting list.  Whenever the previous reservation is canceled, the lecturer will get a notification about the cancellation with a request to confirm the reservation. Then the lecturer just has to confirm or cancel the reservation.
